## Introduction

Roll vanilla, or generate a site for your project to quickly get started with [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} 

## Prerequisites

* git
* [Github.com](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} account
* A static (vanilla) website / webpages or a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, static web site generator, site. For this we will use the 

## Steps

1. Download the [WET](http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html){:target="_blank"} GCWeb Stable Release production files on WET's _gh-pages_ site.
2. Create a new repository on [Github.com](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}
3. Give it a simple name
4. Navigate to the folder you just downloaded the ZIP file to in Windows Explorer
5. Unzip the file
6. Open up the _themes-dist-4.0.##-gcweb_ folder that was in the zip file. This is where we want our root site to be at.
7. Right click on the _root_ folder and select `Git Bash Here`
8. Now follow the Github instructions to push your files to Github, **which we will modify to for today's presentation**
    1. `echo "# simplename" >> README.md`, creates a README.md file with the name of your project as a main title
    2. `git init`, initilizes git and all the awesome power that comes with it 
    3. `git checkout -b gh-pages`, creates and checks out a _gh-pages_ branch
    4. `git branch -d master`, deletes your _master_ branch, you won't need it anymore 
    4. `git add --all` adds all your files into _staging_
    5. `git commit -m "first commit"`, commits with a message
    6. `git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/simplename.git`
    7. `git push -u origin gh-pages`
    8. enter your username and password if asked
9. Create a page in your _root_ folder called index.html
10. Add any HTML markup you want (eg. `<h1>Hello World</h1>`)
11. Commit that page to your _local_ repository
    1. `git status`, see that your new page shows up in the status
    2. `git add --all`, adds the new page to staging
    3. `git status`, shows you that the page is now in staging ready for you to commit
    4. `git commit -m "created and index page for the project"`, commits the new page with a message
    5. `git push origin gh-pages`, pushes your changes to github 
    6. **If Github has any problems building your gh-pages site, it will notify you via email, _let's hope this doesn't happen now_**
12. Visit your Github.com repository at https://github.com/your_username/simplename, you now have your files on Github.com, including your newly created index.html file
13. Visit your site on your own _github.io_ website at http://your_username.github.io/simplename
